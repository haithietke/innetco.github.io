### Intellectual Property Right enforcement works
INNETCO  has involved a numbers of cases related to Intellectual Property enforcement, most of which relate to the prevention of manufacturing and trading of counterfeited goods. The Firm closely cooperates with the National Office of Intellectual Property, Market Management Bureau, Economic Police - Ministry of Public Security, Inspector of the Ministry of Science and Technology, General Department of Vietnam Customs and other agencies to effectively carry out Intellectual Property enforcement.

In order to assist the owners of Intellectual Property Right to exclusively use their subjects of industrial property and protected copyrights, INNETCO  can, if authorized by the client, request the competent authorities to force the infringers to stop the infringement acts and compensate for the damages resulted from infringement.
