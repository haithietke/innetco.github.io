Protection of geographical indications (GIs) always plays an important role in commercial relations at national and international levels. Using misleading geographical indications will be contrary to honest practice in industry and commerce, confusing consumers to GI-protected products. Those using inappropriate GIs will obtain unfair advantages in comparison with their competitors. GIs are used for natural, agricultural, handicraft and industrial products such as: wood, sugar, fruits, wines, coffee, tea, cigarettes, weave, wool…GIs can make great contributions to establish prestige and reputation of a product in consumer’s mind as well as in the importation and exportation of the product. Therefore, GIs are considered as valuable properties of the nation, protection of such assets by law will not only enhance commercial values of GI-protected products but also preserve cultural values and traditional knowledge of the nation crystallized in the products. 

### 1. Definition of Geographical Indication

There is no common definition of GI due various mechanisms of protection of GI from country to country. Followings are some definitions of geographical indication:

“Indication of source” refers to indications of a product originating from a specific geographical area.
“Appellation of origin” refers to indications of a product originating from a specific geographical area that the quality of the product is attributed by environmental, natural and human factors of the geographical area. 
“Geographical indication” associates to both two above-mentioned definitions.
